# UTEK2022 Programming

## About
This repository contains code by Team 2 for submission to the UTEK 2022 Programming Competition.

## Running Instructions
There are five Python files, corresponding to Parts 1-5 in the Competition Handout.

The Python script for Part 1 takes in three input files: 1a.in, 1b.in, and 1c.in;
it outputs three files: 1a.out, 1b.out, 1c.out, respectively.

The Python script for Part 2 takes in three input files: 2a.in, 2b.in, and 2c.in;
it outputs three files: 2a.out, 2b.out, 2c.out, respectively.

The remaining Python scripts run in a similar fashion.

Part 6, as specified in the Competition Handout, is presented as a multimedia file, in this case, a series of Engineering drawings in a PDF.
